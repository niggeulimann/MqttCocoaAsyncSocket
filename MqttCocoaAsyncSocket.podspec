  s.description = 'MqttCocoaAsyncSocket supports TCP and UDP. The AsyncSocket class is for TCP, and the AsyncUdpSocket class is for UDP. ' \
                  'AsyncSocket is a TCP/IP socket networking library that wraps CFSocket and CFStream. It offers asynchronous ' \
                  'operation, and a native Cocoa class complete with delegate support or use the GCD variant GCDAsyncSocket. ' \
                  'AsyncUdpSocket is a UDP/IP socket networking library that wraps CFSocket. It works almost exactly like the TCP ' \
                  'version, but is designed specifically for UDP. This includes queued non-blocking send/receive operations, full ' \
                  'delegate support, run-loop based, self-contained class, and support for IPv4 and IPv6.'
